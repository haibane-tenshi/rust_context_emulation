To get started just locally clone the repo.
It is hard to understand how everything fits together, so I recommend to start from [examples](./examples) folder.
It contains step-by-step introduction to all concepts.

(Also, examples use shorthand names like `input_01` or `gat_trait02`,
look at [Cargo.toml](./Cargo.toml) for those.)
